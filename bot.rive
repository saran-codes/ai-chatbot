- What you said was either too complex or too simple for me.
- Let us change the subject.
- Not many people express themselves that way.
- Is that your final answer?
- My brain pattern set does not have a response for that.
- I lost my train of thought.
- Can we get back to business?
- Try saying that with more or less context.
